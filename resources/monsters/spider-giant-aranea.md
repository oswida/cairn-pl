-   6â€™ long, intelligent spiders of greenish-black coloration. Have an
    odd lump on the back, housing its large brain. Two front legs have
    digits, allowing an aranea to grasp tools. Dwell in web-filled lairs
    where they conduct magical research.
-   Scared of fire, avoid using spells of such effect.
-   Creatures caught in webs are entangled and unable to move. Breaking
    free requires an STR save.
