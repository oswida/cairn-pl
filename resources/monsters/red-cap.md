# Red Cap
4 HP, 10 STR, 12 DEX, 8 WIL, two sickles (d6+d6)
- Borne from blood left to rot in the fae. Hats colored by blood; they even bathe in blood.
- Attack travelers, but will ignore those with little to live for, as there is no pleasure in it.
- Critical damage: eviscerate the target, showering in blood, restoring any lost STR & HP.
