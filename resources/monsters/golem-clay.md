# Golem
16 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR, 6 DEX, 2 WIL, cobblestone fists (d10)
* A hulking 9â€™ tall statue made of clay, mud, and prayer.
* Mindlessly follows whatever commands given by its master, even after their death.
* Immune to mundane blades and missile weapons. Damage from fire is _enhanced_.
* If destroyed, the Golem eventually reforms and carries out its previous orders.
* Uttering the inverse of the spell that created it reduces the Golem to mud.
