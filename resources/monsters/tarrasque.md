# Tarrasque
20 HP, 3 Armor, 20 STR, 8 DEX, 8 WIL, claws (d12+d12)
-   Legendary, gargantuan (50’ long) reptilian monstrosities with plated
    skin, dreaded throughout all lands. Spend most of their time
    sleeping in their underground lairs. Emerge periodically and ravage
    vast swaths of land, consuming all plants and animals in the path.
    Possibly the most feared monster of all.
-   Regenerates 1 HP every turn. A Tarrasque always regenerates, even if
    its body is reduced to pieces. The way of permanently killing it is
    unknown.
-   Critical Damage: The razor-sharp claws sever a part of the victim's
    body.
