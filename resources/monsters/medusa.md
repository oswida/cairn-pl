# Medusa
4 HP, 12 DEX, 16 WIL, snake bites (d6) or gaze (save)
- Deadly magical creatures that look like women with snakes in place of hair.
- Gaze: Anyone who looks directly at the medusa's face must save WIL or be turned to stone. Averting eyes from the face prevents this effect, but impairs any damage dealt. 
- Critical Damage: The snakes' poison paralyzes the victim (d6 DEX damage)
