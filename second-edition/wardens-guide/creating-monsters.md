# Tworzenie potworów

## Overview

To create a unique monster, follow these steps:
- Roll on the [Monster Appearance](#monster-appearance) table.
- Roll on the [Monster Traits](#monster-traits) table.
- Roll on the [Monster Attacks](#monster-attacks) table.
- Roll on the [Monster Abilities](#monster-abilities) table.
- Describe the creature's appearance, abilities, and attacks in plain English.
- Create the creature's stats according to the principles, definitions, and stat block format below.

## Zasady

- Use **Critical Damage** to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Use flavor and style to help creatures stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Always adjust creature stats based on what is fun and interesting.

## **Ochrona przed trafieniem**

A creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardier ones 6 HP, and and give serious threats 10 or higher.

## Pancerz

For some creatures, this represents their natural toughness; for others, it may be from something that is worn or carried. If a creature is able to withstand an attack without moving, raise this number. 

## Punkty zdolności

3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. 

## Siła

Tracks overall health, physical power, and resistance to poisons. It is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! 

## Zręczność

Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick, agile, or nimble, increase the number as necessary. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number.

## Wola

Determines a creature's ability to withstand the influence of another, as well as their power over others. It also acts as a measurement of their defense in magical or spiritual matters.

## Ataki

Typically an object (e.g. sword or bow) or a natural weapon (e.g. claws or teeth).

## Zdolności

A unique action or power the creature can utilize both in and out of combat.

- If an ability can be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Attack and interacts with HP.
- If an ability cannot be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Ability.
- If an ability only affects a single PC, it should generally have an immediate effect with no chance to Save in that round (possibly not at all).
- If an ability is capable of affecting a group of PCs, it should generally call for an immediate Save.

## Monster Stat Block Format

X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Attack (dX, special items, _qualities_)
- An engaging descriptor of appearance, demeanor, or living habits.
- A quirk, tactic, or peculiarity that distinguish this creature.
- Special effect or consequence of critical damage.

## Monster Example

- **Appearance**: _Hunched_ + _Carapace_.
- **Traits**: _Moves in a straight line_ + _Weak Spot_
- **Attack**: _Smashes_ + _Grapples_.
- **Abilities**: _Disables_ + _Hearing_

_A snail-like creature with a hard shell. It moves only in straight lines, and has a soft underbelly. It rolls into opponents, pulling them into its wild orbit. The roar of its movement drowns out any other sounds._

This creature is physically tough, with higher than average **STR** and strong armor. It is probably fast but not maneuverable, and likely doesn't rely on skill or dexterity to avoid danger. It is brutish, but it is still a wild beast and only as willful as any creature just looking for its next meal. It attacks by rolling in a straight line and should impact multiple targets.

### Thunder Snail

6 HP, 2 Armor, 14 STR, 6 DEX, 4 WIL, smash & roll (d10, _blast_)

- Thick-shelled beasts that attack by rolling over their opponents in a straight line. The noise of their tumbling shells is deafening.
- **Critical Damage**: Target is pulled into its rolling momentum, losing an additional 1 STR per round until freed (STR save to escape).

## Converting Monsters

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems. Here are some tips that might help with the process!

- **Hit Protection**: A good rule of thumb is to give the creature +1 HP for every **HD**, on top of a minimum **3 HP** (the average person). I usually think of **HD** as equivalent to a d6, which has a _mean_ of 3.5. Always start with a creature's **HP** _first_, _then_ do their **STR**.
- **Armor**: Look for phrases like "as leather" and "as plate" in the original stat blocks. When converting from B/X style games like Old School Essentials, ignore THAC0 and use descending AC whenever possible (7 = Leather, 5 = Chainmail, 3 = Plate mail). If only ascending AC is given, you can use (12 = Leather, 14 = Chainmail, 16 = Plate mail). Whichever system you're converting from, the Armor values range from 1-3 only.
- **Strength**: Look at the creature's **HD** and **HP**. If a creature is difficult to kill but _not_ because they are nimble or skilled, give them more **STR** (but _not_ more **HP**). Start with 10 **STR** (the average) and go up or down from there.
- **Dexterity**: Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick (often referred to as "speed" or SP), agile, or nimble-fingered, raise the number. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number. See [Saving Throws](#saving-throws) below for more!
- **Willpower**: **Morale** (**ML**) can be a good guidepost, and it typically ranges between 2-12. The greater the creature's personality, spirit, or presence, the higher the WIL they should have. The following table offers a decent guide on converting **ML** to **WIL**.

|         |   |    |    |    |
|---------|---|----|----|----|
| **ML**  | 4 | 8  | 10 | 12 |
| **WIL** | 6 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

### Saving Throws

- You can rely on _saving throws_ to glean more information about a creature's abilities, specifically their ability to avoid death by physical trauma, magic, or poison. 
- Stat blocks will use a shorthand like (E1) or (F1) (Level 1 Elf or Fighter respectively). These are really helpful for quickly identifying the creature's abilities.
- Consider adding descriptive tags such as "immune to toxic gas" or "good at dodging" based on the saving throws. The following table should help determine which saving throws should result in an increase in one of the relevant ability scores.

|                                |                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Death or Poison**            | **STR**            |
| **Wands**                      | **DEX**            |
| **Paralysis or Petrification** | **WIL** or **STR** |
| **Breath Attacks**             | **DEX** or **STR** |
| **Spells, Rods or Staves**     | **WIL**            |

### Walka

- **Damage Die**: Can typically be copied "as is" from most OSR systems, but it's a good idea to check with the weapons listed in the Marketplace first.
- **Multiple attacks**: Convert to _blast_ or to multiple dice (e.g. d6+d6).
- **Devastating Attacks**: Consider making the damage _enhanced_, assign the _blast_ tag, or giving the attack multiple dice.

### Zdolności

- Sometimes the mechanics of the original system simply _do not translate_. That's OK! Try to focus on what's most interesting about the creature, and write a "version" of their ability more appropriate to Cairn.
- Abilities can sometimes be made into attacks (with a damage die), leaving Critical Damage to reveal the real impact. 
- If the monster has an attack that asks the PCs to attempt to dodge or save against some ability, consider making the ability an out-of-combat "trap" that the PCs can trigger. Otherwise, make it succeed automatically. Combat is dangerous, and it is up to the Warden to properly telegraph danger before the fighting begins.

### Magia

- Magical creatures can "know" a bunch of spells without needing to carry Spellbooks. In this case, make their corpses magical (and dangerous)!
- Spells are tricky; you can give magic-users Spellbooks, but remember, they might _drop_ them when defeated.
- Consider making some of the dropped Spellbooks implode (use the Die of Fate to determine which).

### Używaj fikcji

The easiest way to convert a monster from another system is to read the original stat block and any associated text, then write a few sentences about the creature in plain English. Finally, convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this creature:

#### Foxwoman

Can take the form of a fox or a 7' tall fox-headed woman. 
_HD 5, Speed 120', Armor 14, Morale 11, Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)_
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- She appears as a 7-foot tall human woman with the leg of a fox.
- She doesn't have super high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Her **ML** is pretty high, and she's obviously quite willful.
- She is agile and lithe.
- She attacks with teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- She can transform into a fox at will.
- She is immune to metal weapons.

_**What can we learn from this?**_
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. If we start from **3 HP** and add 1 **HP** per **HD**, that means she has **8 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. A normal human has 10 **STR** and she's a little bigger. **12 STR**.
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**.
- Her **ML** is high, and foxes are known for their cunning. **15 WIL**.
- For her attacks, I'd go with claws (d6+d6) and bite (d8).

_**This information leaves us with the following:**_
8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, claws (d6+d6), bite (d8)

_**Now on to her abilities:**_
This is pretty straightforward. We simply read the fictional stat block we created earlier!
- She appears as a 7-foot tall human woman with the head of a fox.
- She can transforms into a fox at will.
- She is immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- She chokes her victims into unconsciousness.

_**The final result**_:

#### Foxwoman

8 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, claws (d6+d6), bite (d8)

- Can take the form of a fox or a woman with a hidden fox leg.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- **Critical damage**: Victim is choked unconscious.
