## Why did you take the Oath?

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Your family has a long tradition of serving, and you were trained from an early age on how to survive in the wild. When taking the [**Supply**](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#supply) action, your yield increases by one step (e.g. 1d4 > 1d6). |
| **2** | As a convict, the Oath was simply a means of avoiding punishment. Take a set of **Lockpicks** and the **Key** (_petty_) to a safehouse.                                                                                                                                |
| **3** | Noble-born, you joined to escape family trouble. Take a **Goosefelt Tarp** (fits two) that you stole before leaving home.                                                                                                                                              |
| **4** | When your family lost everything, you took the Oath to avoid becoming a burden. Take extra **Rations** (3 uses) and a brace of **Throwing Knives** (d6).                                                                                                               |
| **5** | Your life was saved by a member of the **Marchguard**, and you were inspired to join their ranks. Take a **Snare Trap** and a **Sketchbook** filled with detailed drawings.                                                                                            |
| **6** | You were in a dark place and decided that your life needed a little direction. You're still not so sure it was the right choice. Take an **Oilskin Coat** and **Mapping Paper**.                                                                                       |

## What do you carry as proof of your Oath?

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Impressive Pin** | A metal badge of honor from the Guard. It can open doors but leaves a trail. _Petty_.                                                                                                               |
| **2** | **Oath Compass**   | Points not towards North, but instead to the nearest member of the Guard. It also lets you know when they're getting close.                                                                         |
| **3** | **Pullstones**     | Two jet-black stones. When separated, the stones will always roll toward one another.                                                                                                               |
| **4** | **Fireflask**      | Highly alcoholic, yet strangely delicious. When thrown, it creates a wall of flames 10ft high that burns out after a few minutes. 1 use.                                                            |
| **5** | **Pain Band**      | Touch an injured creature to transfer their wounds to you. (Exchange their lost STR with your own.) **Recharge**: Wear the ring while in perfect health. You will lose 1 STR, permanently. _Petty_. |
| **6** | **Poacher's Woe**  | Strongly-scented arrows (3 uses). The scent is powerful enough to track with ease.                                                                                                                  |
