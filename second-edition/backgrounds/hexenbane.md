## To which order do you belong? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Order of the Crossroads**. Take a **Pocket Leyfinder**. It points to nearby ley lines and other sources of arcane power. If you lose it, the punishment is death.                                            |
| **2** | **Order of the Bleeding Star**. Take a **Star-Iron Mace** (d8). It shines faintly in darkness and becomes very hot in the presence of witchcraft.                                                   |
| **3** | **Order of the Glass Sigil**. Take a short sword (d8) and chainmail (2 Armor, _bulky_). You have contacts in most towns (the more rural, the better) willing to provide aid, food, or even weapons.                 |
| **4** | **Order of the Blank Eye**. Take a **Voidglass Shard**. Peer through it to see invisible marks, creatures, and other magical effects. Lose the use of your eye for an hour afterwards (you are _deprived_). |
| **5** | **Order of Canaas**. Once per day, you can change into a wolf. Take a **Quicksilver Chain**. Without it, you are unable to shift back.                                                                           |
| **6** | **Order of the Silent Veil**. Take a **Quell Stone** (2 uses) wrapped in burlap. Extinguishes any nearby flames once exposed to air.                                                                             |

## What was your vow? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | **Honesty**. Choose a **weapon type** (blunt, blade, etc). Attacks against you of this type are _impaired_. If your vow is broken, you lose d4 WIL.                |
| **2** | **Poverty**. You carry the _Disassemble_ **Spellbook**. Only you can use it. If your vow is broken, it explodes (d12 STR damage). Disassemble: Any of your body parts may be detached and reattached at will, without causing pain or damage. You can still control them. _Regenerates any torn or defaced pages._                                 |
| **3** | **Selflessness**. You are immune to **mind-altering magical effects**, such as _charm_, _hatred_, _frenzy_, and so on. If you break this vow, you lose d6 WIL.       |
| **4** | **Mercy**. Choose a **weapon type** (blunt, blade, etc). Attacks with this weapon are _enhanced_. If your vow is broken, you can never use that weapon type again. |
| **5** | **Charity**. Once per day you can shrug off a **Fatigue**. If your vow is ever broken, you permanently lose one inventory slot.                                           |
| **6** | **Valor**. The first time you inflict **Critical Damage**, you receive +d4 HP, returning to the previous limit at the end of combat. If your vow is broken, you die.             |
