## How have you "improved" yourself? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | You have a replacement **eye** that can magnify objects, act as a telescope, and provide minimal night vision. You cannot wear anything metal on your head, and the presence of strong magnets make you _deprived_.                                       |
| **2** | One **foot** is mostly metal (kick, d6), and you treat some [tough](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) terrain as **Easy**. Carry a **Oil Can** (6 uses). Without a daily application, you are _deprived_ and noisy. |
| **3** | One of your fingers has been swapped, the bone replaced by gold and iron. Take a **Hook** and a **Screwdriver** that can attach to the fingertip.                                                                                                         |
| **4** | Both **ears** have been surgically enhanced, tripling your hearing. You can focus on a specific sound, such as a conversation, at a great distance. You wear an ear flap to protect against sudden loud noises (WIL save to avoid temporary paralysis).   |
| **5** | Your **chest** is lined with alchemical sigils, _toughening the skin_ (1 Armor). Wearing other metallic armor nullifies the effect.                                                                                                                       |
| **6** | One **arm** is fully metal and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, _bulky_ when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it.                                                                            |

## What rare tool is essential to your work? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **1** | **Regrowth Salve** | Regrows a body part over the course of a day. 1 use.                                                                                                              |
| **2** | **Graftgrub**      | A small worm that can fuse inanimate objects with parts of the body.  1 use.                                                                                      |
| **3** | **Woundwax**       | Heals wounds from fire or chemicals (restoring full STR) but nothing else. 2 uses.                                                                                |
| **4** | **Quicksilver**    | A stimulant. Go first in combat, and automatically pass any WIL saves for one hour. _Addictive_: Save STR or become _deprived_ after 24 hours without it. 4 uses. |
| **5** | **Pneuma Pump**    | Portable iron lungs (_bulky_). Enables life-saving surgery or underwater breathing.                                                                               |
| **6** | **Lodestone**      | Draws out dangerous elements from the body and acts as a powerful magnetic force.                                                                                 |
