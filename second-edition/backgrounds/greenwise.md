|       |                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **1** | An ill-tempered forest spirit cursed you for stealing, marking you as an enemy of their kind. Take a **Bezoar Stone**. Ingesting it cures any poison (1 use, unless retrieved).              |
| **2** | A close friend disappeared into the forest. Now you see their face in any tea you brew. Take a **Soporific Concoction** (3 uses).                                                            |
| **3** | You were poisoned, losing your sense of taste and smell. You can now withstand noxious fumes and always carry **Antitoxin** (2 uses).                                                        |
| **4** | Your radical experiments turned your skin green, and you now gain nourishment as a plant. You don't need **Rations**, but a day without sufficient sunlight and water leaves you _deprived_. |
| **5** | Your impressive corpseflower won a local contest then promptly killed a judge. You fled, but not without the **Prize Money (100gp)** and a warrant for your arrest.                          |
| **6** | You created a restorative tincture that also causes accidental infertility. Take a **Healing Potion** that completely restores STR. Only you know of its unintended side-effects.            |
