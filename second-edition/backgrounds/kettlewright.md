|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | You build small contraptions for local guilds (and don't ask too many questions). Take an extra 40gp and a wanted poster with your face on it. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door or vault. |
| **2** | You deal in home goods and tools, hawking your wares to townspeople across the lands. Take 20gp worth of items from the [gear](/wip/2e/marketplace#gear) table. You are fluent in the _Traveler's Cant_.       |
| **3** | You were a military smelter, before peace destroyed your livelihood. Take a **smelting hammer** (d10, _bulky_) and a **tin helm** (+1 Armor). Given time and adequate materials, you can repair armor.          |
| **4** | You sell rare and quality items to monasteries and nobles alike. Take a **Spyglass**, a **Necklace** (_petty_) worth 20gp, and a **Scroll** of [Mirrorwalk](/wip/2e/spellbooks) (_petty_).                      |
| **5** | You offer protection as a service, quietly watching for threats as money exchanges hands. You start with **+d4 HP**, and carry a **Long Sword** (d10, _bulky_) and a **Gambeson** (+1 Armor).         |
| **6** | You scavenge raw tin and iron from battlefields, pulling teeth from still-twitching corpses. Start with a young **Donkey** (+4 slots, slow), a **Crossbow** (d8 damage, _bulky_), and a **Saw** (d6).           |

## What never fails to get you out of trouble? Roll 1d6:

|     |                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 1   | **Fire Eggs**      | Six small pellets made of sea salt, wood, and crockery-dust. They explode at low heat (d8, _blast_) but the flames dissipate quickly.                            |
| 2   | **Black Tar**      | Versatile: both sticky and highly flammable. 3 uses.                                                                                                             |
| 3   | **Spiked Boots**   | Cracks heads (d8) as easily as it does ice and muck. Travel is also a bit slower, but easier.                                                                    |
| 4   | **Tinker's Paste** | Seals shut any fist-sized opening. 3 uses.                                                                                                                       |
| 5   | **Fireworks**      | A dazzling albeit dangerous display. Enough explosive material to blow off a finger or three. 2 uses remain.                                                    |
| 6   | **Carrion Cat**    | A clever pet, small enough to hide in your pack (_bulky_), but strong enough to scare off smaller predators. Requires one **Ration** a day, and it must be meat. |
|     |                    |                                                                                                                                                                  |
